### What is yHaCkSlAcKpAcK?.
A collection of slack integrations to make your life easier and your work flow-ier.
Interactions with the external services are text-based, via a bot. 
There are 3 integrations provided out-of-the-box, but they're all built on a framework that makes it easy to add more. All you need is an API (and some python)!
